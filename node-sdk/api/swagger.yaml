    \ call, our service rings the next phone number or extension in the queue. While\
    \ your callers are waiting to be connected, you can choose to play Hold Music."

  description: "Routes, a.k.a. \"Call Handling Rules\" or \"Presets\", are used to\
    \ tell Phone.com how to handle incoming phone calls. They can be used to connect\
    \ your Phone.com phone number to an extension, a menu, a calling queue, or many\
    \ other things. The fundamental element of a route is an action. We support many\
    \ different actions such as forward, menu, and voicemail. See below for the full\
    \ details. In general, actions are processed one at a time in the order you specify,\
    \ until the call is answered or disconnected. Answering or disconnecting stops\
    \ any additional actions from being performed. Note that several actions such\
    \ as voicemail, menu, and fax completely take over processing the call and do\
    \ not result in processing any subsequent actions. Actions are grouped into rule\
    \ sets. Rule sets can be filtered based on the time of day or the caller's phone\
    \ number. When processing an incoming call, Phone.com's routing engine will evaluate\
    \ each rule set in the order that was specified when the route was created or\
    \ updated. The first matching rule set will be used, and all other rule sets will\
    \ be ignored. Each route must have at least one unfiltered rule set. Note that\
    \ if your route contains multiple unfiltered rule sets, only the first one will\
    \ be used."
