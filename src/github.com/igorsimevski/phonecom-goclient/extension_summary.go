// The Extension Summary Object is used to briefly represent an extension. It can be seen in several places throughout this API. Here are the properties:
type ExtensionSummary struct {

	// ID of the extension. This is the internal Phone.com ID, not the extension number callers may dial.
	Id int32 `json:"id,omitempty"`

	// User-supplied name for the extension. On POST, leaving this empty will result in an auto-generated value. On PUT, this field is required.
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`

	// Extension number that callers may dial. On POST, leaving this empty will result in an auto-generated value. On PUT, this field is required.
	Extension int32 `json:"extension,omitempty"`
}
